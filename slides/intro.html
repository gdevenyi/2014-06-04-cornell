  <h1>Our Mission</h1>
  <p>
    Teach basic lab skills for scientific computing
    that will make you more productive.
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
    Our goal is to teach basic lab skills for scientific computing
    to researchers in fields as diverse as cosmology, oncology, and economics.

  <h1>What We Teach</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="fragment span5">
      the Unix shell
      <br/>
      Git and GitHub
      <br/>
      Python
      <br/>
      SQL

	build modular code

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <aside class="notes">
    We will cover the basics of the Unix shell, version control with Git, programming in Python, and using SQL.
    What we're really teaching, though, is how to automate repetitive tasks,
    how to track and share work,
    how to grow a program in a modular, testable, reusable way,
    and how to structure data.

  <h1>Seven Plus or Minus Two</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Short-term memory can only hold 7&plusmn;2 items at once.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Must structure programs and programming to fit this hardware limit.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    Three themes will run through our teaching.
    The first is that human short-term memory can only keep about seven things straight at once.
    If the number of facts you need to hold in your head to write or understand the next line of code crosses this threshold,
    your error rate will go up and your productivity will go down.
    The most important thing in programming is therefore to structure software so that
    you only need to pay attention to a few things at once.

<section>
  <h1>Mental Fatigue</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Brains get tired after 45-90 minutes of concentration.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Must structure work so that each task can be completed in this time or less.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      And move around a bit between sprints.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    The second theme is that your brain gets tired just like any other part of your body.
    More specifically, under most circumstances you can only concentrate for 45-90 minutes
    before you stop absorbing new information.
    The second most important thing in programming is therefore to break down programming (and other things)
    so that every task can be completed in this much time or less,
    and to get up and move around for a few minutes between each work sprint
    in order to flush fatigue poisons from your brain.

<section>
  <h1>Mental Fatigue (cont.)</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Five 8-hour days per week maximizes total productivity (not just productivity per hour).
      <ul class="fragment">
	<li>
	  See Evan Robinson's <a href="http://legacy.igda.org/why-crunch-modes-doesnt-work-six-lessons">Why Crunch Mode Doesn't Work</a> for a summary.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      So get some rest.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    A corollary is that a century of research on sleep deprivation has shown that
    forty hours of work per week, spaced out, maximizes total productivity.
    Any more than this,
    and the errors you're making don't just cancel out the extra time:
    they actually set you back.
    If you really want to get things done,
    you should take a walk, read a book, cook a meal, and most importantly, get some sleep.

  <h1>Science!</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We actually know a lot about both learning and software development.
      <ul class="fragment">
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Learning-Works-Research-Based-Principles/dp/0470484101/"><em>How Learning Works</em></a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321/"><em>Making Software: What Really Works and Why We Believe It</em></a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Base what and how we teach on the best available evidence.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    The third and final theme of this class is that we actually know a fair bit about learning and software development&mdash;not everything,
    but more than most people realize.
    As far as possible,
    we base what we teach and how we teach it on the evidence summarized in these two books,
    because that's what scientists are supposed to do.

    Finally,
    Software Carpentry is a volunteer organization:
    we teach because we are scientists ourselves,
    and want to help our friends and colleagues get more done in less time, and with less pain.
    You don't have to be an expert programmer&mdash;in fact, we would prefer that you're not&mdash;so
    if you're interested,
    please get in touch.
